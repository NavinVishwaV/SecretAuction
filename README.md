## Features

- **Bid Submission**: Users can enter their name and bid amount.
- **Highest Bid Tracking**: The application automatically tracks and updates the highest bid.
- **Error Handling**: Alerts users if invalid input (e.g., non-numeric bid) is entered.
- **Final Result Display**: Shows the name and bid of the highest bidder when bidding ends.
